Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate in Quantitative Marketing at S.C. Johnson College of Business, Cornell University.

As an empirical researcher in Quantitative Marketing, I study how digital platforms and e-commerce services impact consumer behavior and market processes. My research focuses on how changes in market thickness on C2C platforms retain local biases after the integration of asymmetric markets. I also examine how online grocery shopping affects consumer purchasing patterns in both developed and developing settings, highlighting the shifts in shopping habits due to digital channels. Overall, my research provides important insights into the evolving e-commerce landscape and its effects on consumer choices and market efficiency. Methodologically, I use machine learning techniques to capture latent patterns in large sets of shopping data, enabling the identification of comparable shopping trips or products. Building on this, I apply various econometric and causal inference tools to rigorously evaluate my research questions and derive meaningful insights.
<!-- My research interest is in the area of online grocery retailing. The first essay of my dissertation examines the differences in shopping behavior when consumers use online grocery shopping. In another project, we study the differences in online grocery adoption in an emerging market. -->
<!-- In my other research streams, I investigate how to leverage digital consumption experience by implementing diverse cues to help consumers achieve their goals. -->
