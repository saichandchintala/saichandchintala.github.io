Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate in Quantitative Marketing at S.C. Johnson College of Business, Cornell University.

My research interests are focused on e-commerce, particularly in the online grocery market, and digital platforms. The first essay of my dissertation examines the differences in shopping behavior when consumers use online grocery shopping. Additionally, I am involved in a project that studies the adoption of online grocery shopping in an emerging market. In another project, I study consumer behavior on an online C2C marketplace with a quasi-exogenous change in market thickness.
