Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate in Quantitative Marketing at S.C. Johnson College of Business, Cornell University.

My research interest is in the area of online grocery shopping. The first essay of my dissertation examines the differences in shopping behavior when consumers use online grocery shopping. In another project, we study the differences in online grocery adoption in an emerging market.
<!-- In my other research streams, I investigate how to leverage digital consumption experience by implementing diverse cues to help consumers achieve their goals. -->
